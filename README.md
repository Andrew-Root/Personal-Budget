This Python application is a financial management tool designed for users in Australia.
It allows users to track their weekly income, expenses, and savings, while converting savings from AUD to EUR.
The app provides interactive visualizations, including pie charts for weekly, monthly, and annual financial breakdowns.
Users can input their financial data (e.g., income, rent, food, transport, leisure, etc.) and view a summary table with details in both AUD and EUR.
The app also stores weekly financial data in JSON files, enabling users to load and analyze previous data for insights on their financial trends over time.
